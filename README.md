# Amazon API Gateway to AWS Lambda to Amazon DynamoDB and Stream to Kinesis and finaly trigger a Lambda

This pattern explains how to deploy a SAM application with Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB and Stream to Kinesis and finaly trigger a Lambda. When an HTTP POST request is made to the Amazon API Gateway endpoint, the AWS Lambda function is invoked and inserts an item into the Amazon DynamoDB table.


Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/nguyendinhthi0705/apigateway-dynamodb-lambda-kinesis.git
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd apigateway-dynamodb-lamdda-kinesis
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
1. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

1. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

## How it works

When an HTTP POST request is sent to the Amazon API Gateway endpoint, the AWS Lambda function is invoked and inserts an item into the Amazon DynamoDB table.

## Testing

After deployment, use the AWS Management Console (explained below) to test this pattern by sending an HTTP POST request to the Amazon API Gateway endpoint (found in the CloudFormation console Stacks Outputs tab) to confirm an item is added to the Amazon DynamoDB table. Alternatively, a command line shell or another application can be used to send the HTTP POST request.

Using the Amazon API Gateway console, select the API, Resources, and POST method execution. Click Test on the Client box and the Test button without a request body. The request should return a response message 'Successfully inserted data!'. If any errors occur, this view also shows logs from the invocation for troubleshooting. Navigate to the Amazon DynamoDB console to verify the item was added into the table.
Sample data for test:
{
    "id":"6",
    "name":"Cash",
    "description":"cash money",
    "customer":"John"
}

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME
    ```
1. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```
